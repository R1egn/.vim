*restrictions
	- A major general idea is that all filesystem stuff should point to 
	  the repo. Is that a good idea? Or should the repo contain scripts to 
	  push out settings to where Vim expects them. Or should Vim be set to 
	  look for the repo.
	- Hold up!!!! Why use OneDrive or Dropbox at all for syncing, it can 
	  just be a backup.
	- A major restriction that I have is that on my work computer IM003327 
	  I only have OneDrive and Dropbox isn't allowed.

*ideas
	- the repo should reside under ~/.vim
	- Perhaps put the settings in GitHub
	- make it Git compatible
	- make it Dropbox compatible. Push to here?
	- make it OneDrive compatible?

*todo
	- change _vimrc to point to ~/.vim

*done
	- Acer all-in-one <--> Dropbox : both _vimrc and /viminfo/
	- Chloe <--> Dropbox : linux_vimrc
	- IM003327 <--> OneDrive?
