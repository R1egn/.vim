- All file system stuff should point to the files inside the repository. Is 
  that a good idea? (Yes it is.) ~~Should the repository contain scripts to 
  push out settings to where Vim expects them.~~ Or should Vim be set to look 
  for the repository. (Yes)
- Steve DONE: link setup, cmd mouse setup, git setup, removed old stuff
- 2Face DONE in Linux
- change inside \_vimrc to make Vim look for vimfiles first at ~/.vim/vimfiles
